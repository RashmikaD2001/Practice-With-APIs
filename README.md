I used https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list as the API. I implement three functions. 
1. searchYourUniversity(name) - search university by the name {university name is the paramter}
2. getAllUniversitiesByCountry(country) - get all universities by the country name {country name is the paramter}
3. compareNumberOfUniversitiesInCountries(countries) - return country name and number of universities and number of universities in the country as a dictionary {list of country names are parameter pass to function}
4. apiDetail() - return details about the API

   In compareNumberOfUniversitiesInCountries method I visualize the data in dictionary as a bar graph
